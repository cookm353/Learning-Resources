# Learning-Resources <a name="top">
In starting my learning process, I've found a wide range of resources to use to further my education in data science, computer science, and other related topics.  This repository will be an attempt to impose some kind of order so it'll be easier for me to continue learning, along with anyone else who may stumble upon this.
  
## YouTubers
* [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g) - This channel focuses more on how to use the language, with tutorials on the core language, NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Django, Flask, object oriented programming, and other topics.
* [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/featured) - This channel focuses on Python, but also covers JavaScript and Go.  Sentdex and Corey Schafer should be the first places you check when trying to learn a topic.
* [Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/consumerchampion) - This channel is primarily focused on Python from a data science perspective.  I've found many a resource from him.
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) - This channel provides overviews of various topics in math, such as linear algebra and calculus.  A good place to go to get a basic conceptual understanding before taking a deep dive.
* [Brandon Foltz](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrandonFoltz/featured) - Statistics, statistics, and more statistics
* [Steven Skiena](https://www.youtube.com/user/StevenSkiena) - This is the channel of a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University and director of the AI institute at the same university.  He's recorded his lectures from a number of courses he teaches, including analysis of algorithms and data science.
* [Coding Entrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodingEntrepreneurs) - This channel focuses on both Python and JavaScript, so it naturally has a stronger focus on web development.  30 Days of Python covers all of the basics, and then goes on to cover APIs, web scraping, Jupyter, and a number of other intermediate level topics.  He also has videos on Django and using Python with OpenCV and Docker, which is helpful for app development.
* [Guarav Sensei](https://www.youtube.com/c/GauravSensei) - This channel's primary focus is on competitive programming and interview prep, which will be very helpful when it comes try to actually make some money off your coding hobby.  His playlist on CS fundamentals are a good place to start.
* [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) - A Python focused channel with a variety of playlists.  You can find ones focusing on machine learning, neural networks, individual modules (Kivy, PyQt5, Selenium, Django, NumPy, etc.), and general Python programming playlists as well.

#### [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT)
This channel needs section unto itself.  Rather than provide a description, I'll simply provide links to playlists of courses.  I'll organize this section a little better when I have an opportunity.
